People in their panic unable to cope
Colliding with each other
Desperate and confused
Victims of their own reason
Determined to succeed
They try so hard to satisfy their curiosity

I've just heard the best joke in the world
I had to laugh it was so absurd
I've just heard the best joke in the world

Now you laughter freezes
Cold sweat on your lips
You're searching for a different kind of magic
Take a deep breath
To start all over again
Searching for a different kind of magic

I've just heard the best joke in the world
I had to laugh it was so absurd
I've just heard the best joke in the world

You haven't stopped this season
That's not unusual
This is the time to realise your big potential

I've just heard the best joke in the world
I had to laugh it was so absurd
I've just heard the best joke in the world

Take a deep breath
To start all over again
You're searching for a different kind of magic

I've just heard the best joke in the world
(You haven't stopped this season)
I had to laugh it was so absurd
I've just heard the best joke in the world
I had to laugh it was so absurd
I've just heard the best joke in the world
I had to laugh it was so absurd
