[00:10.51] Man of fashions flow - die
[00:13.86] Time has come to say - goodbye
[00:31.64] We spit on your - grave
[00:35.18] Slay all in sight - rage
[01:56.46] All their power's gone
[02:04.38] A battle we have won
[02:12.37] No more trust to them
[02:20.72] This is the end
[03:06.82] So is the utterdark - revenge
[03:09.86] And now the laughter has - died
