We were walking hand in hand
Walking barefoot in the sand
And this empty-headed would all seem so far away

We thought time was on our side
As we raced against the tide
And summer was an endless game the two of us could play

But when all the laughter is over
I'll be the fool you left behind
When all we had was a moment lost in the echoes of my mind

Was it ever meant to last?
Why did summer go so fast
And all those childish games we used to play belonged to yesterday

Dreams that slipped tight through our hands
Fade like footprints in the sand
And the castles that we made have all been washed away

But when all the laughter is over
I'll be the fool you left behind
And all we had was a moment lost in the echoes of my mind
